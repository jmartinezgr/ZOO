# Zoo Management Streamlit App

**_Important Notice: This app is implemented but not hosted so if you want to see how it looks follow this link [Video](). I appreciate your understanding._**

This project was designed and developed as part of the "Programming for Engineering" course‚Äîan elective in the Systems and Computer Engineering program at the National University of Colombia. Our group was inspired to utilize this assignment to assist university students. The application focuses on a familiar CarPool system tailored specifically for National University students, aiming to leverage class learnings and individual resources to achieve our goal.

## Getting Started üöÄ

These instructions will guide you to obtain a functional copy of the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Check out **Deployment** to learn how to deploy the project.

### Prerequisites üìã

_What you need to install the software and how to install it, apart from Python, of course ([Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/))._
```
pip install streamlit protobuf
```
_Or you can install everything automatically by accessing the folder after cloning the repository (see instructions below) and executing the following commands to install the requirements._

```
cd ZOO
pip install -r requeriments.txt
```

### Instalation üîß

_A series of step-by-step instructions to teach you how to run the application in your local browser._

_**First Step**_

_Navigate to the folder where you want to store this project through the command prompt (cmd) on your computer and clone this repository or download it as a **ZIP** file_

```
cd your_desired_folder
git clone https://github.com/jmartinezgr/ZOO.git
```

_After cloning the repository, access the **Streamlit** project folder._

```
cd ZOO
```

_Once inside the folder, you can run the application following the deployment section._

## Deployment üì¶

_Run a command to start your local **Streamlit** server, which you can access as usual and use the app just like the web version. However, you have the freedom to modify its code and use your computer's storage_

_It's time to execute the following command... _

```
streamlit run Hello.py
```

_Now you can check if the application deploys correctly at this [link](http://localhost:8501/). It's time for you to enjoy using the app üôÇ (Remember not to close the bash or your command prompt so that the app keeps running, and when you want to stop the server, you can do so by executing the ctl + c command)._

_You can find more information on how to start and handle a Streamlit application in this [link](https://streamlit.io/components/)._
